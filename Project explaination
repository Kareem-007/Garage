In this project, we designed a smart garage that has a smart lighting system, automatic controlled gates that control the number of cars in the garage, and an LCD that shows the number of available car slots inside. This project is an application for some arduino learned topics as we used an Arduino microcontroller to control the circuit including: -LDR (Photoresistors) -Buzzer -Servo motors -LCD screen -IR sensor

The garage has fixed amount of car parking slots (n). The garage open the gates normally when it is empty, but when it reaches full capacity, the entrance gate doesn't open again. The LCD screen shows a welcome messgae and the number of empty slots available. The LDR are responsible for smart lighting system in the garage based on the natural sun lighting.
